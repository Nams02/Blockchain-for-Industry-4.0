## Abstract
Due to the proliferation of ICT during the last few decades, there is an exponential increase in the usage of various smart applications such as smart farming, smart healthcare, supply-chain & logistics, business, tourism and hospitality, energy management etc. However, for all the aforementioned applications, security and privacy are major concerns keeping in view of the usage of the open channel, i.e., Internet for data transfer. Although many security solutions and standards have been proposed over the years to enhance the security levels of aforementioned smart applications, but the existing solutions are either based upon the centralized architecture (having single point of failure) or having high computation and communication costs. Moreover, most of the existing security solutions have focussed only on few aspects and fail to address scalability, robustness, data storage, network latency, auditability, immutability, and traceability. To handle the aforementioned issues, blockchain technology can be one of the solutions. ==Motivated from these facts, in this paper, we present a systematic review of various blockchain-based solutions and their applicability in various Industry 4.0-based applications==. Our contributions in this paper are in four fold. Firstly, we explored the current state-of-the-art solutions in the blockchain technology for the smart applications. Then, we illustrated the reference architecture used for the blockchain applicability in various Industry 4.0 applications. Then, merits and demerits of the traditional security solutions are also discussed in comparison to their countermeasures. Finally, we provided a comparison of existing blockchain-based security solutions using various parameters to provide deep insights to the readers about its applicability in various applications.

## Summary

### INTRODUCTION
With the wide popularity of Internet and related technologies, various Industry 4.0-based applications have been used across the globe in which sensors and actuators sense, compute and communicate the data for industry automation.
As in Industry 4.0-based applications, data between different locations flows using an open channel, i.e., Internet, so threats to security and privacy has increased manyfold [^1].
Weiss et al [^28] discussed about blockchain public healthcare applications
They have explored how the blockchain technology eliminates the centralized authority during the verification process, its digital signatures [^29] for safe data repository, its architecture, and the challenges.
From the above-mentioned proposals, we found that most of the recent surveys on the blockchain technology have concentrated on various smart application areas in Industry 4.0 and its security parameters [^43], [^44].

### RESEARCH CONTRIBUTIONS OF THIS PAPER Following are the research contributions of this paper

The merits and demerits of the current security solutions which are applicable in Industry 4.0 are discussed.
The Open issues and challenges in Industry 4.0 based smart applications are presented.
Rest of the paper is organized as follows.

### BACKGROUND
It allows the exchange of values and trust for different users without involving the central authority; Data security: Security compliance is a major and essential requirement of blockchain technology with a legal point of view; Decentralised data storage: It is a basic requirement of the distributed system; Immutability: All the records on the network should not be modified or tampered in the shared ledger
This enables the integrity of the stored data; Consensus: Transactions should only be updated when all the verified users in the network agree for the same; Typed Blocks: It is required for the smart contract and for high speed payment in business transactions.
The log data is recorded in log files for future inspection for the security, governance, or compliance

### BLOCKCHAIN DEPLOYMENT IN SMART APPLICATIONS
Whether the information or data shared among the members of other supply-chain is trustworthy or not
To overcome this issue, authors of [^60] proposed a system called Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP), which provided real-time food tracing information to all SCM members and has features like reliability, openness, neutrality, security, and transparency.
This comparison has been done using parameters such as reliability, encryption, security management, edge computing, architecture, consensus mechanism, threat model, framework implementation, advantages, and disadvantages of the existing approaches

### MANUFACTURING
The process of manufacturing includes several elements such as operations management, asset management, intelligent manufacturing, planning, the interaction of humans and machines, performance optimization, performance monitoring, and end-to-end operational visibility.
Cloud-based manufacturing basically use the centralized networks which have problems such as security, flexibility, availability, and efficiency
To resolve such issues, the authors of [157] discussed and developed a blockchain-based distributed network architecture known as BVmfg.
The authors of [157] discussed and developed a blockchain-based distributed network architecture known as BVmfg
This architecture had a total five layers which improved the trust between the service providers and users for secured service sharing.
To overcome the limitations of the traditional agri-food logistic systems, the authors of [^63] proposed a blockchain and RFID-based agri-food supply chain traceability system
This system significantly improved the quality and safety of food, and reduced the probability of different losses in the conventional logistics process.
The parameters used for this comparison are transparency, reliability, security, architecture, consensus mechanism, traceability system, framework, advantages, and disadvantages of the existing approaches

### OPEN ISSUES AND CHALLENGES
We highlight the open issues and challenges in some application domains such as healthcare, IoT, energy, business, smart city, agriculture, energy, and supply-chain & logistics.
3) ESTABLISHING TRUST In todayâ€™s era, how to establish the trust is the major problem for everyone because any third party creates major issues with the ongoing situation or breaches the data and increases the redundancy which makes more difficult to trust anyone
In such scenarios, the blockchain can be used to prevent hampering and establishing the trust as it uses the cryptographic hash for building the blocks and immutable nature of the ledger.

### CASE STUDIES
In order to demonstrate the use of blockchains, we have tried to implement the blockchain technology for two different applications: smart farming and tourism & hospitality.
We have discussed the use of the blockchain technology for a variety of applications such as smart farming, smart healthcare, supply chain & logistics, energy sector, IoT, smart city, business, manufacturing, agriculture, and tourism & hospitality.
We need a perfect tracing and management system for ensuring food safety during each process of production and supply [166]
Customers take the help of online reviews of different tourism products to make a decision
They think that all the reviews of real travelers are honest and true, but most of the tourism & hospitality industry players, (i.e. Hotels, Travel agencies, or restaurants) use centralized platforms to store and maintain these reviews.
All the transactions are maintained through blocks with unique identities which eliminates the creation of duplicate or fake online reviews

### Findings
It has been observed that the consumers can reduce the energy bill by 38%

### CONCLUSION
We provide insights to the readers about the importance of the blockchain technology for various smart applications, where security remains paramount.
This survey is divided into five parts.
The Third part of our paper focuses on the real-time deployment of the blockchain for various applications such as smart healthcare, smart farming, supply-chain & logistics, business, tourism& hospitality, energy, agriculture, digital content distribution, smart city, IoT, and manufacturing which are considered in the survey part of the paper.
To demonstrate the suitability of the blockchain technology for smart applications, the last part of our paper illustrates case studies on two application domains: smart farming, and tourism & hospitality.
We plan to explore the feasibility of developing a blockchain-based infrastructure for precision agriculture in future


## Study subjects

### 15 Recently, many tourism companies
- TOURISM & HOSPITALITY In this case study, we highlight the current issues in the tourism industry and show how they can be resolved by implementing the blockchain mechanism. ==We present a case study that follows the process model shown in Fig. 15 Recently, many tourism companies like Expedia Group, BCD Travel, Uber, Ola, and AirBnb have replaced their conventional business models by C2C models to achieve transparency and security in transactions==. There is a huge demand for innovative platforms in the tourism industry to integrate technology, money, and knowledge

## Findings
- It has been observed that the consumers can reduce the energy bill by 38%

##  Builds on previous research

## Contributions
- In this paper, we provide insights to the readers about the importance of the blockchain technology for various smart applications, where security remains paramount. This survey is divided into five parts. The first part discusses the traditional security systems, background, and history of the blockchains. The second part describes the basic architecture of the blockchain technology, including the verification of each transaction in the distributed network which makes a permanent, verified and unalterable nature of ledger for the information or data. Moreover, the blockchain reference architecture which consists of three different networks such as public network, cloud network and enterprise network. The Third part of our paper focuses on the real-time deployment of the blockchain for various applications such as smart healthcare, smart farming, supply-chain & logistics, business, tourism& hospitality, energy, agriculture, digital content distribution, smart city, IoT, and manufacturing which are also considered in the survey part of the paper. The fourth part emphasizes on the open issues and challenges in Industry 4.0-based smart applications and suggests some blockchain based solutions for those applications. Finally, to demonstrate the suitability of the blockchain technology for smart applications, the last part of our paper illustrates case studies on two application domains: smart farming, and tourism & hospitality. We plan to explore the feasibility of developing a blockchain-based infrastructure for precision agriculture in future.

## Future work
