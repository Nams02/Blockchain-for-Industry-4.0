## Abstract
Abstract Internet-of-Things (IoT) has made ubiquitous computing a reality by extending Internet connectivity in various applications deployed across the globe. IoT connect billions of objects together for high speed data transfer especially in 5G-enabled industrial environment during information collection and processing. Most of the issues such as access control mechanism, time to fetch the data from different devices and protocols used may not be applicable infor future applications as these protocols are based upon a centralized architecture. This centralized architecture may have a single point of failure alongwith the computational overhead. So, there is a need for an efficient decentralized access control mechanism for device-to-device (D2D) communication in various industrial sectors IoT-enabled industrial automation. In such an environment, security and privacy preservation are major concerns as most of the solutions are based upon the centralized architecture. ==To mitigate the aforementioned issues, in this paper, we present an in-depth survey of state-of-the-art proposals having 5G-enabled IoT as a backbone for blockchain-based industrial automation for the applications such as-Smart city, Smart Home, Healthcare 4.0, Smart Agriculture, Autonomous vehicles and Supply chain management==. From the existing proposals, it has been observed that blockchain can revolutionize most of the current and future industrial applications in different sectors by providing a fine-grained decentralized access control. Various transactions and database logs can be traced efficiently using blockchain for consistency and preivacy preservation in the aforementiioned industrial sectors. The open issues and challenges of 5G-enabled IoT for blockchain-based Industrial automation are also analyzed in the text. Finally, a comparison of existing proposals with respect to various parameters is presented which allows the end users to select one of the proposals in comparison to its merits over the others.

## Summary

### Introduction
IoT and its usage in various industrial sectors is growing at an exponential rate from the past few years.
For securing IoT network [^13],[^14], a lot of Blockchain solutions are available few operate on fast trusted networks and other work faster on unreliable networks.
For the situation, where new blockchain operates efficiently and rapidly over unreliable networks 5G enabled IoT devices can utilize the same in the real-time.
After the availability of the mathematical proof, a perfect environment is possible where fast and trusted nodes have been connected in the network and can take the benefit from 5G by using specific cloud or fog layers.
Integrating blockchain with IoT enable to maintain an immutable ledger of transactions of information exchange
By achieving this in a decentralized P2P manner, the ‘middle-man-attack’ can be eliminated, which allow the users to share without relying on a trusted third party [^15].
We discuss some open issues and challenges which may hinder the growth of blockchain technology

### Scope of this survey
Preexisting surveys explored various aspects of blockchain with IoT [^16],[^17],[^18],[^19],[^20],[^21],[^22],[^23].
Some of these are discussed as follows.
Dorri et al [^16] proposed a secure and lightweight architecture for IoT, based on blockchain technology.
Singh et al [^22] focused on the security aspects of blockchain based IoT systems.
To the best of our knowledge, these had been focused on how to use blockchain with IoT for either security purposes or decentralized storage purpose only.

### Contribution of this survey
Several research proposals exist in the literature covering blockchain and IoT, but few had considered the potential of high-speed connectivity in the IoT devices using blockchain.
We investigated the role of blockchain for industrial automation with 5G-enabled IoT devices.
Following are the major research contributions of this paper: We present a comprehensive and systematic review of blockchain-based 5G-enabled IoT and discussed its potential industrial applications.

### Organization and reading map
Rest of paper is structured as follows.
We discussed briefly about how the 5G wireless technologies helps to overcome some of the issues of the traditional systems.

### Background of blockchain and 5G-enabled IoT devices
This section covered the background of blockchain, 5G-enabled IoT, and is divided into three subsections.
We discuss the basic information about blockchain, and how it is ‘disrupting’ the modern era.
We discuss the concept of IoT, its characteristics, limitations, and how 5G revolutionize the IoT paradigm.
We discuss the potential advantages of combining these two paradigms which forms the foundation of the paper

### Blockchain
The advent of crypto-currencies like Bitcoin [^24] blockchain technology has emerged as the disruptive technology.
Blockchain is different from other distributed systems based on consensus and following properties [^25]: Trust-less: The entities involved in the network are unknown to each other
They can communicate, cooperate, and collaborate with each other without knowing each other which means there is no requirement of certified digital identity to perform any transaction between the entities.
There are certain limitations with the usage of IoT, which need to be resolved in order to evolve it into a more efficient system [^30],[^31]: Security: As the number of connected devices of the network increases, the chances to exploit vulnerabilities by external attacks increases.
Road safety and smart street lighting can make the citizens’ life easier with reduced overall cost to maintain the structures

### Usage of blockchain in 5G-enabled IoT
With the development of smart applications to improve the quality of life of the citizens, IoT plays a vital role in the digitization of services.
Centralized data storage systems such as-cloud computing has contributed significantly to the development of IoT
It seems to act as a black box, where the participants are unaware of the usage of the information they share on the network.
Such a centralized structure may fails to provide data transparency [^37].
It can be able to trace the origin of any required information
It can provide a trusted means for authentication and authorization of IoT devices.
It allows them to securely update IoT devices [^38]

### Blockchain deployment in 5G-enabled smart industrial automation
A master taxonomy of blockchain-based industrial applications in 5G-enabled IoT is shown, which includes existing areas of interest for application such as-Smart city, Smart Home, Healthcare 4.0, Industry 4.0, Agriculture, Autonomous vehicles and Supply chain management.
In all these applications, blockchain and 5G are used to improve the security, to increase the bandwidth, and to reduce the overall operational as well as capital expenditure, respectively.
The detailed description of these applications is discussed in the following subsections

### Smart home
A smart home is an embodiment of a technologically enriched living environment, which aims to improve the quality of life of inhabitants [^39].
With the IoT, smart home systems coordinate with the devices to automate certain actions based on the usage statistics to provide real-time uninterrupted services according to the users’ preferences.
The data handled by such system could be forged by any intruder who tries to circumvent the lock system to gain unauthorized access to the system
To address this issue, Han et al [^42] proposed a blockchain-based smart door lock system, which provides security features like authentication, data integrity, and non-repudiation.
Han et al [^42] proposed a blockchain-based smart door lock system, which provides security features like authentication, data integrity, and non-repudiation
They used a set of Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor, ultrasonic sensor, and a motion sensor to detect indoor/outdoor intruders.

### Smart city
The increasing trend of people to migrate to urban areas coupled with the associated process of urbanization, It creates many complex challenges regarding the cities’ overall infrastructure and their ability to provide citizens with the basic necessities like water, energy, transportation, and healthcare.
Pham et al [^50] proposed an algorithm which increased the efficiency of the cloud-based smart-parking systems based on IoT technology.
Biswas et al [^54] proposed a blockchain-based security framework which allowed the entities to communicate in a smart city, while preserving privacy and security
They aimed to tackle various security threats which are discussed as follows: Availability threats: It is concerned with unauthorized upholding of resources.
To provide security features during data exchange, blockchain technology such as-Ethereum are integrated with this layer
This integration step is quite challenging, since the requirements are different for different industrial applications.

### Supply chain management
Chain is the network of individuals, organizations, resources, and activities that are involved in the life cycle of a product.
Dewey et al [^34] discussed the impact of two technologies on supply chain; blockchain and 5G-enabled IoT.
The main component blochchain technology is smart contract which can enable automatic payment of goods upon their receipt, thereby eliminate the need for a third-party confirmation
Another important aspect is to eliminate disputes regarding whether a distributor is entitled to a volume incentive rebate.
Casado-Vara et al [^74] suggested a model of supply chain, where the use of blockchain is to provide security to the information of companies involved in the agricultural supply chain along with multi-agent systems for effective coordination of internal activities.
This model enables a new market model called circular economy.

### Agriculture
Smart agriculture use modern technologies, such as IoT, GPS, and Big Data to improve the quality and quantity of the resultant agricultural products.
Zhang et al [77] proposed a blockchain-based traceability system for agricultural food supply chain, for the Chinese market which addressed the issues related to food safety.
A similar model was proposed by Tse et al [84], where they used the concept of blockchain technology to improve security of the food supply chain in China.
Caro et al [85] proposed a blockchain-based decentralized traceability system for agri-food supply chain management, known as AgriBlockIoT.
It promises transparency and auditable asset traceability to store data from the IoT devices along the complete supply chain in the underlying blockchain.

### Autonomous vehicles
With rapid technological developments in sensing, communication, analysis, and computation, the growth of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) has been formidable.
To overcome the aforementioned challenges, Yuan et al [89] proposed a blockchain-based secured, trusted, and decentralized autonomous ecosystem for ITS, known as B2ITS
It is steeping stone for PtMS (Parallel Transportation Management Systems) framework, which aims to optimize the real-world transportation systems using parallel interactions with their counterparts.
The advantages such decentralized applications are; to eliminate the unwanted decisions and risks taken by the central system such as-surge pricing, and privacy leaks
Complementing such novel ventures, Huckle et al [^15] proposed an automatic payment system, known as AutoPay, which was a service that provides security and trust by ‘embodying’ the user through the use of smart contracts on its blockchain interface.

### Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), known as drone, is an airborne system or an aircraft operated remotely by a human operator or autonomously by an on-board computer [95].
Ubiquitous mobile networks such as-5G can be used to operate them beyond the LOS communication
They offer wide-area, high speed, and secure wireless connectivity, which can improve the control and safety of the device [97].
Sedjelmaci et al [98] implemented a cyber-security system based on Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to safeguard UAVs from external cyber attacks [99].
In this model, every UAV can monitor the behaviour of its peers.
Kuzmin et al [100] proposed a distributed, scalable, and secure model called UAV communication network (UAVNet), as a potential means of safe, real-time information exchange between UAVs. UAVNet was a blockchain network with each UAV acts as a blockchain node.
Proposed a secure network for inter-UAV communication.

### 12 U Model
✗ Model UAV-based IoT networks in drone platform communication was not discussed.
The 51% attack not U Model UAVNet taken into account.
1: Usage of Blockchain, 2: Proposed any model, 3: Focused on, 4: Communication Standard, Notation: U: considered, ✗: not considered

### AIRA protocol
LTE/4G/ 5G with the satellite navigation system by executing relevant smart contracts at the required time.
An external storage can be included in this model: a blockchain repository, similar to a black-box of an airplane.
Another use case of UAV is crowd surveillance.
Motlagh et al [101] proposed a UAV-based crowd surveillance model using facial recognition with Open Source Computer Vision (OpenCV).
In this model, when UAVs are equipped with remotely controlled IoT devices it can offer various value added services (VAS).
When coupled with more advanced communication standards such as-5G networks, UAVs can have the support for extreme real-time video surveillance and streaming.

### Multimedia and digital right management
Media distribution is a form of digital distribution of multimedia contents such as-audio, image, and video [106].
Cloud-based Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are generally preferred over the traditional CDNs, owing to their lower housing cost, since owning of infrastructure is not required
These systems have certain inherent issues which are difficult to resolve, given the centralized architecture of current Digital Rights Management systems (DRM).
Kishigami et al [104] proposed a blockchain-based content distribution system to assist the media creators demand an efficient way for digital rights management.
In this technique, right holders themselves have the power to operate the system.
Right holders themselves have the power to operate the system
This framework complements the current DRM systems, where the latter requires an authentication mechanism, which is provided by the former, using blockchain.

### Open issues and challenges
While the amalgamation of IoT and blockchain is received considerable research interest both from academia and industry.
Before considering to apply this concept in existing systems, these issues need to investigated further: With the rapid increase in IoT devices being battery-powered, but their energy requirements are limited.
With the introduction of blockchain, where block mining is a computation-intensive task
In these scenario, the energy requirements and processing time of devices need to be explored further.
Blockchain was introduced to supplant the current client/ server systems
This information is be stored in the nodes, which are usually the IoT devices.
Lack of proper standardization and no interoperability means different ledgers cannot directly communicate with each other
They require the involved stakeholders to highly compromise to achieve full interoperability.
With the advent of 5G technologies, IoT devices should be upgraded so as to be compatible with the high-speed network connectivity

### Conclusion
End user will be enjoying the services of 5G the integration of blockchain with IoT devices becomes a game changer.
We provide insights to the readers about the industrial applications of blockchain in 5G-enabled IoT devices.
Discussion is divided into three parts, firstly discussed the background of blockchain, IoT, and 5G briefly followed by respective industrial applications.
Open issues and challenge have been covered mainly for industrial applications.
Most of the industrial applications have been covered in this work, where blockchain will be used to maintain the security faster data flow.
Lastly comparative analysis of the existing blockchain-based industrial applications is performed on the basis of specific parameters.
We would minimize our discussion on healthcare only and plan to propose a blockchain based secured healthcare system
