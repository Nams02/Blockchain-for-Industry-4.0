## Contributions
- SCM has entered the big data era ([^Choi_et+al_2018_a]; [^Kuo_2019_a]), and blockchain technology has emerged as a disruptive technology. It is commonly believed that blockchain has a huge potential to transform the SCs, both global and local, by improving operational efficiency, data management, responsiveness, transparency and smart contract management. With blockchain bursting out on the scene, it can act as a source of competitive advantage for companies, governments and all kinds of organization in the society. Investments are being made by different companies and countries in exploring the new applications with blockchain to achieve a higher operational efficiency. The blockchain industry is also moving toward various areas, including the standardization issue and the way to integrate different blockchain systems together.<br/><br/>This article provides a thorough review of 178 research articles and covers several aspects of blockchain technology in SC and logistics management. It starts with a brief overview of blockchain architecture and its characteristics, as well as some of the im­ portant literature reviews on blockchain in SCs and the uniqueness of the current work. As mentioned earlier, the key benefits of blockchain in SCs, various applications of blockchain in different SC functions and operations, and societal impacts are some of the major aspects being covered in this review article, which are under-examined in the prior review papers.

## Future work
- We examine several industrial sectors such as shipping, manufacturing, automotive, aviation, finance, technology, energy, healthcare, agriculture and food, e-commerce, and education among others that can be successfully revamped with blockchain based technologies through enhanced visibility and business process management. A future research agenda is established which lays the solid foundation for further studies on this important emerging research area.
- It strives to capture the meaningful data from the plethora of literature available using a systematic literature searching methodology. It uncovers the current trends of blockchain in SC operations and paves way for future research. As a remark, the scope of this work is restricted to SCs. The trend of research in this area has been accelerating since 2017 and has continued at an enormous pace. Through this paper, we try to provide insights by addressing the following research questions: How can blockchain enhance SC performance? What are the sectors most impacted by blockchain technology? Which SC functionalities are most impacted and in which way? What are the different applications of blockchain in SCs of various sectors? What are the challenges and future scope of research for blockchain implementation in SC?.
- Relevant in scope societal impacts and challenges of blockchain implementation in supply chain management (SCM) and logistics services are presented in Section 6. Section 7 summarizes the work with future research followed by the conclusion in Section 8.
- Most current review papers commonly include bibliometric review of many blockchain papers, including conferences. Some of them focus on examining blockchain adoptions for understanding applications and future research in SCM ([^Surjandy_et+al_2019_a]; [^Gurtu_2019_a]; [^Saberi_et+al_2019_a]). [^Hastig_2019_a]) examine blockchain applications for SC traceability, and some important successful implementation factors. [^Khosla_et+al_2019_a]) discuss the basic overview of blockchain in SCM and its usability in practices. [^Juma_et+al_2019_a]) present a survey on blockchain in trade SCs and its challenges in SC design while integrating blockchain. [^Wang_et+al_2019_a]) highlight that blockchain majorly has a potential for enhanced data sharing, record management and role-based access. The authors focus on the related research in designing new structural frameworks, models, architecture, etc., but details about actual or prototype implementation are largely missing. In Shen and Pena-Mora (2018), the relevant application cases for smart and sustainable cities are discussed based on four pillars - social, economic, environmental and governmental. The authors show that Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric are the most commonly used platforms for blockchain applications. In Choi et al (2019), the authors review the analytical literature using the mean–variance approach for responsive supply chain operations using air logistics. The authors highlight the role played by blockchain.
- Applications of blockchain technology in different sectors of industry and society. Blockchain technology has the capability of resolving bottlenecks, paving way for future research, addressing issues using shared, secured, distributed and permissioned transactional ledgers. These features have made it inevitable and a forefront runner of the research in various industrial sectors ([^Al-Jaroodi_2019_a]). Blockchain helps inter-chain management, improves project management, enhances inter-chain sustainability, relationship modelling, new product development and inter-chain coordination in different sectors globally ([^Pankowska_2019_a]; [^Cole_et+al_2019_a]). Blockchain drives innovation in business modelling and value propositions, especially in start-ups and entrepreneurs. Provision of open source software, new set of applications and removal of third party all would help blockchain to boost innovation in industries ([^Hughes_et+al_2019_a]). Blockchain, if consciously applied to the SC problems, can generate huge benefits ([^Hoek_2019_b]). We have found numerious applications and implementations of blockchain in SCs of different industries and sectors that would help enhance the welfare of the society. In the following, we present some of the key sectors with its industrial and societal impacts.
- Discussions and future research agenda.
- A solid reference for adoption framework (identifying, discovering and analysing relevant processes) and organization redesigning process (new business and governance models) should be developed to take advantage of the opportunities posed by blockchain. We have identified and listed topics for future studies in various major SC arenas below: Challenges.
- A sincere effort and attention to standardize blockchain implementation in SC is required so that it can be scaled to a global level and can overcome the regulatory barriers. Implementing product deletion, price tracking, and business process management on SCs in different sectors in real life deserves further studies. Values of SC reengineering using blockchain should be examined in depth.
- The case based approach in areas like heathcare SC, Cab services, last mile in e-commerce, and other service sectors can be explored where customer authentication, data confidentiality and privacy, and integrity assurance must be restored with heigest priority. All these issues can be investigated in future research.
- Future research should explore how blockchain enables digital trust, demand supply management, confidentiality in customer order process, and interorganizational business process through smart contracts and distributed ledger technology. Inadequate in­ frastructure and prominent barriers for the adoption of blockchain are still major concerns for various industries. Issues like lack of understanding of blockchain implementation, data storage centers and maintenance costs, scalability issues, data ownership issues, lack of top management and organizational support, trained technical staff, trust among SC partners, and legal challenges are some of the key barriers. Chain operations managers should understand and do in-depth research on the cause-effect relationships, influences and dependencies among these barriers while implementing blockchain in their business settings.
- In previous sections, we can see that blockchain has high potential and impacts on various industrial sectors. Many potential future research areas can be identified. Please refer to Table 7 for more details. Note that some of these future studies are proposed in the reviewed studies, and some are based on our examinations of the real world practices.
- All these could act as valuable references for researchers and supply chain managers. An extensive future research agenda in various SC functions and operations, business process management and SC sustainability including potential research in different industrial sectors has been proposed.
- This review article will help researchers and practitioners to better understand and identify SC areas and industry sectors in which blockchian technology could be used. The current trends, challenges, and potential scope for future research opportunities around the use of blockchain for supply chain operations are discussed.
- Blockchain overview and adoption challenges in supply chains. [^Al-Jaroodi_2019_a]) This paper highlights that the blockchain technology has the capability of resolving bottlenecks, paving way for future research, addressing issues using shared, secured, distributed and permissioned transactional ledgers which have made it inevitable and a forefront runner of the research in various industrial sectors.
